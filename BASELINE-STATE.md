# Pre-Externalization Baseline

**Date**: Thu Sep  4 18:02:05 PDT 2025
**Commit**: ce56faa39deb34fcf75cf549b66383e64d6264a9  
**Purpose**: Complete development history baseline before NPM package extraction

## State at Baseline
- **Version**: v0.3.0 with complete modernization stack
- **Commits**: 45 commits representing comprehensive modernization journey
- **Architecture**: Bun + Lefthook + BiomeJS + Framework integration complete

## Modernization Components Complete
- ✅ Bun ecosystem migration (runtime, bundling, TypeScript)
- ✅ Lefthook git hooks (parallel execution, YAML configuration)  
- ✅ BiomeJS integration (unified linting/formatting)
- ✅ Framework specification methodology
- ✅ Comprehensive fork management strategy
- ✅ Docker infrastructure enhancements

## Planned Post-Baseline Changes
- Extract src/ to @peterkc/cipher-* npm packages
- Implement modular architecture with workspace management
- Establish independent project identity and community
- Integrate deeply with Context Engineering Framework

## Usage
This baseline enables intelligent upstream change analysis after independence:
- Compare: `git diff tracking/pre-externalization..upstream/main`
- Analyze: `./scripts/upstream-intelligence.sh`
- Evaluate: Package-relevance assessment for cherry-pick decisions

Complete development history preserved for strategic reference and analysis.
