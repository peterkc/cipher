# BiomeJS Migration Requirements

## User Stories and Acceptance Criteria

### Unified Toolchain Migration

**User Story**: As a developer, I want to use BiomeJS instead of ESLint and Prettier, so that I have a single unified toolchain for faster linting and formatting.

#### Acceptance Criteria (Results-Validation EARS)
1. WHEN BiomeJS is installed THEN the system SHALL use a single package for both linting and formatting
2. WHEN migration is complete THEN the system SHALL remove 6 separate ESLint/Prettier dependencies
3. WHEN biome commands run THEN they SHALL provide equivalent linting and formatting functionality

**Evidence-Based Validation**:
```
✅ The system SHALL install single BiomeJS dependency → VERIFIED: @biomejs/biome@2.2.2 installed in devDependencies
⏳ The system SHALL remove ESLint/Prettier packages → PENDING: Migration in progress, cleanup after script integration
✅ WHEN biome check runs, the system SHALL process TypeScript files → VERIFIED: biome.json configuration functional with TypeScript support
```

### Code Quality Preservation

**User Story**: As a developer, I want to maintain existing code quality standards, so that the migration doesn't compromise our established formatting and linting practices.

#### Acceptance Criteria (Results-Validation EARS)
1. WHEN BiomeJS processes code THEN it SHALL preserve existing formatting standards
2. WHEN BiomeJS lints code THEN it SHALL catch the same categories of issues as current ESLint setup
3. WHEN migration completes THEN existing code SHALL require no formatting changes

**Evidence-Based Validation**:
```
✅ The migration SHALL preserve code formatting standards → VERIFY: git diff shows no unexpected formatting changes
✅ The system SHALL maintain linting rule behavior → VERIFY: BiomeJS catches same issues on sample problematic code
✅ WHEN migration is complete, existing code SHALL be valid → VERIFY: biome check passes on current codebase
```

### Workflow Integration

**User Story**: As a developer, I want seamless integration with existing workflows, so that pre-commit hooks, CI/CD, and development scripts continue working without disruption.

#### Acceptance Criteria (Results-Validation EARS)
1. WHEN package scripts run THEN they SHALL use BiomeJS commands with same interface
2. WHEN pre-commit hooks execute THEN they SHALL use BiomeJS for validation
3. WHEN build process runs THEN it SHALL include BiomeJS checks successfully

**Evidence-Based Validation**:
```
✅ The system SHALL maintain script interface compatibility → VERIFY: npm run lint, npm run format work as expected
✅ WHEN pre-commit hook runs, it SHALL use BiomeJS → VERIFY: Hook executes biome check and validates code
✅ WHEN build executes, BiomeJS SHALL integrate successfully → VERIFY: Full build completes with biome validation
```

## Critical Constraints Only

### Safety Requirements
- **Formatting Preservation**: Migration MUST NOT introduce unexpected code changes
- **Workflow Continuity**: Pre-commit hooks and CI/CD MUST continue functioning
- **Build Compatibility**: Existing build process MUST complete successfully with BiomeJS

### Integration Requirements  
- **Package Script Compatibility**: Existing npm run commands MUST work with same interface
- **Configuration Migration**: BiomeJS configuration MUST provide equivalent rule enforcement
- **Error Handling**: BiomeJS MUST provide clear error messages for validation failures

## Scope Limitations

### What This Migration Includes
- Main project ESLint/Prettier → BiomeJS migration
- Package.json script updates for unified commands
- Configuration file consolidation (3 files → 1 file)
- Pre-commit hook integration

### What This Migration Excludes
- VS Code extension setup (developer choice)
- Performance optimization beyond standard BiomeJS benefits  
- Custom rule development or BiomeJS configuration extensions
- Migration of UI subproject tooling (separate consideration)
