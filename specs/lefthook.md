# Lefthook Migration Specification

**Version**: 1.1.0
**Status**: ✅ Complete
**Context**: Git hooks management optimization for cipher project
**Implemented**: 2024-01-04

## Executive Summary

Replace Husky with Lefthook to modernize git hook management with improved performance, parallel execution, and better configuration flexibility in the cipher AI agent framework.

## Problem Statement

Current Husky implementation presents several limitations:
- **Performance bottlenecks**: Sequential hook execution
- **Maintenance overhead**: Complex shell-based configuration
- **Deprecation warnings**: Current setup shows compatibility warnings
- **Limited flexibility**: Basic file filtering and execution control

## Solution Overview

Migrate to Lefthook for enhanced git hook management:
- **Native performance**: Go-based binary with parallel execution
- **Configuration clarity**: YAML-based declarative configuration
- **Advanced filtering**: Glob patterns and regex support for file selection
- **Modern architecture**: Single dependency-free binary

`★ Insight ─────────────────────────────────────`
• Lefthook's parallel execution reduces commit-time delays significantly
• YAML configuration provides better maintainability than shell scripts
• Go-based implementation eliminates Node.js dependency overhead
`─────────────────────────────────────────────────`

## Technical Requirements

### Current State Analysis
- **Husky version**: 9.1.7 (dependency in package.json)
- **Hook configuration**: Minimal pre-commit setup in `.husky/_/`
- **Integration**: npm "prepare" script for initialization
- **Current workflow**: Executes via `precommit` script with quality checks

### Target Architecture

**Core Components**:
- **Lefthook binary**: Single Go executable managing all hooks
- **Configuration file**: `lefthook.yml` defining hook workflows
- **Integration scripts**: Bun-based quality gates and build processes

**Hook Workflow Design**:
```yaml
pre-commit:
  parallel: true
  commands:
    format-check:
      run: bun run check:write
      stage_fixed: true
    typecheck:
      run: bun run typecheck
      fail_fast: true
    test:
      run: bun run test:ci
      fail_fast: true
    build-verify:
      run: bun run build
      fail_fast: true
```

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Lefthook Installation & Configuration
- Install lefthook as dev dependency
- Create `lefthook.yml` configuration file
- Mirror existing precommit workflow with parallel execution
- Add file-specific filtering for optimization

### Phase 2: Workflow Migration
- Map current `precommit` script to Lefthook commands
- Configure parallel execution for non-dependent tasks
- Add stage_fixed for auto-formatting workflows
- Implement fail_fast for critical quality gates

### Phase 3: Husky Removal
- Remove `.husky/` directory and configuration
- Uninstall husky dependency from package.json
- Update "prepare" script to use lefthook install
- Clean up git hooks configuration

### Phase 4: Optimization & Validation
- Add file filtering for targeted execution
- Configure Docker support if needed
- Validate hook performance improvements
- Document new developer workflow

## Configuration Details

### Proposed lefthook.yml
```yaml
# Lefthook configuration for cipher project
pre-commit:
  parallel: true
  commands:
    # Code quality and formatting
    format-code:
      run: bun run check:write
      glob: "*.{ts,js,json}"
      stage_fixed: true

    # TypeScript compilation check
    type-check:
      run: bun run typecheck
      glob: "*.{ts,tsx}"
      fail_fast: true

    # Unit test execution
    test-units:
      run: bun run test:ci
      glob: "*.{ts,js}"
      fail_fast: true

    # Build verification
    build-check:
      run: bun run build
      fail_fast: true

# Future hook potential
pre-push:
  commands:
    integration-tests:
      run: bun run test:integration
      skip:
        - merge
        - rebase
```

### Package.json Changes
```json5
{
  "scripts": {
    "prepare": "lefthook install",
    // Remove precommit script - handled by lefthook
  },
  "devDependencies": {
    "lefthook": "^1.5.0"
    // Remove husky dependency
  }
}
```

## Performance Benefits

### Expected Improvements
- **Execution Time**: 40-60% reduction through parallel processing
- **Resource Usage**: Lower memory footprint with Go binary
- **Configuration Clarity**: YAML vs shell script maintainability
- **Error Handling**: Built-in fail_fast and stage_fixed capabilities

### Benchmarking Strategy
- Measure current precommit execution time
- Compare with parallel lefthook execution
- Track developer experience improvements
- Monitor hook reliability and consistency

## Migration Risks & Mitigation

### Technical Risks
**Risk**: Hook execution differences between Husky and Lefthook
**Mitigation**: Thorough testing of all quality gate scenarios

**Risk**: Developer workflow disruption during transition
**Mitigation**: Gradual rollout with clear documentation and training

**Risk**: Configuration complexity increase
**Mitigation**: Start with simple 1:1 migration, optimize iteratively

### Rollback Strategy
- Maintain Husky configuration during testing phase
- Document rollback procedure for emergency reversion
- Ensure git hooks can be disabled if issues arise

## Success Criteria

### Functional Requirements
- [x] All current quality gates execute correctly
- [x] Parallel execution reduces total hook time
- [x] File filtering optimizes execution scope
- [x] Developer experience improves or maintains parity

### Performance Targets
- Hook execution time: <30 seconds (vs current baseline)
- Parallel efficiency: >50% time reduction for independent tasks
- Configuration clarity: YAML readability over shell complexity

### Quality Gates
- All BiomeJS formatting checks pass
- TypeScript compilation succeeds
- Unit test suite completion
- Build process verification

## Documentation & Training

### Developer Documentation
