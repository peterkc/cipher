# [SPEC_NAME] Specification

```xml
<system-reminder>
**[SPEC_NAME] Framework Methodology**: Framework specification approach with evidence-based evolution
<task>Apply systematic analysis with proportional rigor: user stories + current state analysis + implementation tracking</task>
<data>
Methodology: User story context + evidence-based documentation + results-validation EARS
Complexity: [Simple/Complex] - [lightweight/comprehensive] approach with essential structure
Technology: [Technology stack and constraints]
Focus: Stakeholder value, critical constraints, working solutions
</data>
</system-reminder>
```

## Framework Specification Structure

This [SPEC_NAME] follows Framework methodology for [simple/complex] projects:

```
specs/[spec-name]/
├── README.md              # Navigation and overview file
├── CLAUDE.md              # This operational context file  
├── requirements.md        # User stories with results-validation EARS
├── design.md              # Current state analysis + architecture decisions  
└── tasks.md               # Implementation tracking and validation
```

## Implementation Guidelines

### **Framework Approach**
- **Requirements**: Focus on user value and critical safety constraints
- **Design**: Current state analysis + key technology decisions with rationale
- **Tasks**: Implementation progress log with discoveries and validation

### **Evidence-Based Evolution**
- Document constraints as they're validated during implementation
- Record architecture decisions as they're made with rationale
- Log implementation progress with real blockers and solutions
